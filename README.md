# Fuzzy-C-means-Implementation-
 This repository contains an efficient and flexible implementation of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm in Python. FCM is a form of clustering that allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, providing a more nuanced clustering approach compared to hard clustering methods.
